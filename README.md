## Description

Code Fellows wants to reinvent the Ops course to be tailored towards penetration testing and ethical hacking. To this end, at the Ops101 level, they want to introduce people to the basics of how to hack. They want to create a safe environment for practicing hacking skills--a "cyber range" as it were.

The core of the range is browser-based. The goal is to give people who are at the introductory knowledge level exposure to what is going on under the hood of their web browsers, and how it can be exploited.
